1. No, it contains two functions with the same name "proc" defined in the same scope
The later one will overwrite the previous one
2. Yes
3. No, the proc function does not explicitly return any value; it prints the result instead.
Should modify the proc function to return a value instead of printing it
4. Yes
5. No, it calls the proc function with only one argument (5). However, the proc function is defined to accept two arguments (x and y).
6. No, it calls the proc function with two arguments (5 and 4), but the proc function is defined to accept only one argument (x).
7. Yes
8. It prints 10. The reason for this behavior is that the proc function modifies a local variable x, but it does not modify the num variable in the main function. 
9. Yes, the provided Python program is legal. The variable x is used in two different places: as a parameter in the proc function and as a local variable in the main function. 
10. Yes, the provided Python program is legal. In Python, the names of the actual parameters and formal parameters do not need to match. The function proc can accept the value of y as an argument and perform calculations on it using the name x within the function.
